## How to run this application

Download the files from this repository and open up the index.html file.
You will be able to not only see the webpage and all its' links, but you will
also see that all the tests using Jasmine have passed.


Update: The Udacity sites that I was testing seem to have somewhat frequent errors when loading, so although all tests initially passed when I completed & submitted this project for review, nowadays not all of the tests pass due to errors on Udacity's end. From what i've been told, it may be server issues with the sites from Udacity for testing.
